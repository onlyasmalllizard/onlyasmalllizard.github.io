    <p>
        I am an entry-level developer based in Birmingham, UK. I work primarily with Ruby, Javascript, HTML, and CSS, but am always happy to learn
        new languages and tools. I love the problem-solving nature of coding and am looking for a work environment that encourages collaboration on
        interesting problems.
