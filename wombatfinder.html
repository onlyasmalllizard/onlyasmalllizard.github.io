<p>
    <strong>wombatFinder</strong> finds pictures of wombats using Google's Custom Search API.
    It saves resulting image urls to a database. Each database entry has two custom fields: one for
    the image url and one called "truewombat", which is a boolean set to true by default. When the
    "Not a wombat" button is selected, the application updates the database entry to set "truewombat"
    to false. This prevents pictures that do not contain wombats from being shown a second time.
