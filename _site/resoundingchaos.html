    <strong>Resounding Chaos</strong> was my entry into the <strong>Gamemaker's Toolkit Game Jam 2020</strong>. I made it in collaboration with
    Rose Russell. The theme for the game jam was "out of control".
</p>
<p>
    In the game, the player attempts to control a mystical being of sound by changing the frequency and amplitude of smaller beings. The 
    mystical being's frequency and overall power is affected by that of the smaller being it consumes. If the frequency matches, the mystical
    being grows stronger, and the rate at which the player achieves points increases. If the frequency doesn't match, the mystical being's
    frequency is shifted slightly towards that of the lesser being, and the rate of point gain decreases. The strength of both of these is
    affected by the amplitude of the smaller being, with higher amplitude causing a greater effect.
